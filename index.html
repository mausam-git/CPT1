                    <p>Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is a type of work authorization for students to learn practical skills related to their major area of study. Common forms of CPT include paid or unpaid internships, co-ops, and part-time or full-time jobs.</p>
                    <p>CPT is an integral part of the student's established program curriculum. Students who complete CPT will earn 1 credit after the course is completed, but neither the CPT course nor the CPT experience is required to graduate.</p>
                    <p>The CPT policies and procedures set forth by WUST are in full compliance with the regulations propagated by USCIS.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Eligibility Requirements</h2>
                    <p><strong>In order to be eligible for CPT, you must:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have an active F-1 status</li>
                        <li>Have completed 1 academic year in the same degree-awarding program (not an ESL school) while physically in the United States. This is equivalent to 3 quarters at WUST in the same program (or 2 semesters at a semester-based university).</li>
                        <li>Be enrolled for a full course of study while engaging in CPT (unless on WUST-approved annual vacation).</li>
                        <li>Have a CGPA of at least 2.0 (undergraduates) or 3.0 (graduates)</li>
                        <li>Be in good academic standing (receiving an F grade will lead to immediate CPT revocation, and students who receive an F grade are not eligible for CPT their next quarter).</li>
                        <li>Adhere to the ongoing rules and obligations of your F-1 visa</li>
                        <li>Clear any outstanding balance (or be in compliance with your payment plan, if you have one).</li>
                        <li>Have not already applied for OPT (for after graduation of your current program).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you fail to maintain the eligibility requirements once your CPT has been approved, your CPT authorization may be revoked or any extension request may be denied.</p>
                    <p>WUST offers CPT to transfer-in students who have completed one academic year in a degree awarding program, or those who are coming off of OPT and are beginning a new program. Transfer students must provide an official transcript from their previous institution as proof they meet the eligibility requirements.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">When to Apply</h2>
                    <p>Eligible students may apply for CPT before the quarter begins. It is strongly recommended students apply for CPT at least 2 weeks before their projected start date so there is enough time for WUST to process the CPT application. The application deadline is the first Friday of each quarter at 12:00pm.</p>
                    <p>Please note that we will not be accepting CPT applications past this deadline under any circumstances. This policy also applies to applications submitted before the deadline that require further necessary revisions in order to grant CPT authorization. To avoid this risk, we strongly encourage students to apply as early as possible. WUST will deny applications if the employer/supervisor does not verify the employment offer within 10 days of the start date passing. CPT applications must meet all the requirements outlined on our website to gain approval. Any applications that do not meet the requirements, including incomplete applications, will not be approved.</p>

                    <h3>1) Job offer letter</h3>
                    <p>You must obtain a job offer letter before applying for CPT. The letter must have the following:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <h3>2) CPT Application Form</h3>
                    <p>You can download the CPT application form here. Make sure you fill out the form completely.</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Do NOT ask your employer to sign page 2 of the form. WUST will contact your employer directly for their signature.</p>
                    <p>Once you have both the job offer letter and the completed application form, you can submit your CPT application through the link: <a href="#">CPT Application Upload Form</a> (forms-db.com).</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Application Fee</h2>
                    <p>Once you submit your application, it will be reviewed by Student Services. The CPT fee will be added to your Populi account. You must pay the fee before your application can be approved.</p>

                    <h3>CPT Fees:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CPT Fee (Per Authorization): $420</li>

                    <h3>CPT End Date</h3>
                    <p>If your job offer letter provides an end date for the offered employment, you must use that end date on your CPT application.</p>
                    <p>If no end date is specified on your job offer letter, you may create your own end date or leave the end date blank. If you leave the end date blank, WUST will authorize your CPT employment for the maximum time you are eligible for (up to 3 quarters or until the end of your program, whichever is shorter).</p>
                    <p>WUST currently authorizes CPT for up to 3 quarters at a time. As the end of your authorization approaches, you may apply for a CPT extension if you choose. An employment verification letter will be required from the employer instead of your original job offer letter. If you wish to change employers, you must remain with your employer until you receive an offer (or receive an offer within 10 days of your last day working with that employer). You must notify the university (i.e., Career Service Center and/or ISO) within 10 days if your employment ends and fill out this <a href="#">CPT End Date Form</a>.</p>
                    <p>If your employment ends, and you are still waiting on an employment offer after 10 days, you should apply instead for the following term.</p>

                    <h3>Full-Time or Part-Time</h3>
                    <p>On your CPT application, you must indicate whether the job is full-time or part-time. There are only 2 options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Part-time employment: 0-20 hours per week</li>
                        <li>Full-time employment: 21-40 hours per week</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Students are not authorized to work more than 40 hours per week.</p>

                    <h3>Dates of Employment</h3>
                    <p>You cannot begin work until you receive an updated I-20 with CPT authorization on it. You can only work during the dates specified on your I-20, and only for the employer specified on your I-20.</p>
